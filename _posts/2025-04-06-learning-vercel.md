# Welcome Back to My Dev Blog!

**Hello World!** This is actually my **second** blog post, and Iâ€™m excited to share what Iâ€™ve been learning recently! In my first post, I shared a bit about who I am and what this blog is going to be about. Now, Iâ€™ve been diving deeper into web development and learning how to integrate **Vercel** for deployment and **Stripe** for payment processing in my projects.

## What Iâ€™ve Been Working On

For this post, I want to talk about my experience setting up **Vercel** and **Stripe** in my latest web store project.

### Why Vercel?

I decided to use **Vercel** because itâ€™s an excellent platform for deploying and hosting static sites and web apps built with frameworks like Next.js, which Iâ€™m using in my store. It's super easy to connect your GitHub repository to Vercel, and every time I push updates to my **preview branch**, it automatically deploys. It's hands-off deployment that lets me focus on coding.

### Stripe Integration for Payments

For the payment side of things, I integrated **Stripe** into my store to handle secure payments. It was a bit challenging at first, but Stripe's documentation is incredibly helpful. Iâ€™ve learned a lot about how to create products, handle payment intents, and manage customer data, which is crucial for any e-commerce site. Stripe offers easy-to-use APIs that Iâ€™ve been experimenting with, and Iâ€™m looking forward to testing out more advanced features like subscriptions and invoicing in the future.

### The Learning Process

While setting up both **Vercel** and **Stripe** was a little overwhelming at first, itâ€™s been an amazing learning experience. Iâ€™ve encountered some challenges with configuring environment variables for the production environment on Vercel, but Iâ€™ve learned how to manage different branches for testing and preview purposes before pushing anything to production. Itâ€™s been great seeing my updates live so quickly.

## Whatâ€™s Next?

Now that I have the basic deployment and payment systems in place, Iâ€™ll be working on adding more features to my store, such as:

- **Customizing the Storefront** â€“ Making the frontend visually appealing with styling.
- **Handling Taxes** â€“ Integrating Stripe Tax for region-based tax calculation.
- **Adding User Registration** â€“ Allowing customers to create accounts and track their orders.

Iâ€™m really excited about the next steps and will share more updates soon. Stay tuned for future posts where Iâ€™ll dive deeper into these features!
